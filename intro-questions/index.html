        <p>1. Daniil Gerasimov, Communication Design, Junior</p>  
        <p>2. I'm taking this class as part of Com Des curriculum. I'm excited for the chance to improve my digital interaction and web development skillset in context of my design practice!</p>
        <p>3. I took a Web Development class my freshman year. I can't say I remember a whole lot of details off the top, but I hope it'll all come back to me fairly easily.</p>
        <p>4. I would love to generally expand my proficiency with both HTML, CSS and JS</p>
        <p>5. I see plenty of differences, from vertical vs. horizontal scrolling to the various distances from which the reader views digital and print materials.</p>
        <p>6. <a href=”https://meltedzine.neocities.org/”>https://meltedzine.neocities.org/</a> I think my friend Elliott's website is incredibly well designed. It effectively flips every boring convention of contemporary minimalist webdesign and truly engages the viewer into an idiosyncratic experience.</p>
        <p>7. <a href=”https://www.newyorker.com/magazine”>The New Yorker: </a>I think the New Yorker's website does a great job at communicating the magazine's content, values and style through a combination of type, illustration and layout elements.</p>
        <p>8. <a href=”google.com”>Google:</a>it feels like a very effective search engine to me; it delivers on its premise effectively.</p>
