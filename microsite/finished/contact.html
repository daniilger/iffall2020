<h2>VOLUNTEERS NEEDED</h2>
<p>There are lots of ways that you can help. Come be a part of the team!</p>
<h3>Visitor Center Volunteers</h3>
<p>We are currently seeking volunteers who can help in the Visitor Center on Saturday mornings or afternoons.  We are looking for a few extra folks so that we can have an alternating or rotating schedule that supports plenty of flexibility for our volunteers as we understand Saturdays are a popular time for many other activities.  Morning shifts are 9am - 12:30pm, and afternoon shifts are 12:30pm - 4pm.  The visitor center is open year-round and supported entirely by park volunteers.  All proceeds from sales in the Visitor Center directly support Paynes Prairie.  Please contact Ashley to learn more.</p>
<h3>Ranger Station Volunteers</h3>
<p>Volunteer 4 hours per week, on Fridays, Saturdays, or Sundays.</p>
<h3>Resource Management Team</h3>
<p>The park is also assembling a resource management team for seasonal maintenance along the Gainesville-Hawthorne Trail and selected trails, and fence repair and removal.</p>
<h3>Additional Positions</h3>
<p>Additional positions include grant writer/coordinator, fundraiser, and event coordinator.</p>
