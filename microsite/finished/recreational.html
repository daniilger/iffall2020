  The park contains exhibits and an audio-visual program at the visitor center that explains the area’s natural and cultural history. A 50-foot (15 m)-high observation tower near the visitor center provides a panoramic view of the preserve. Eight different trails provide opportunities for hiking, horseback riding, and bicycling. Ranger-led activities are offered on weekends, November through April. Fishing on Lake Wauburg is allowed and a boat ramp provides access for canoes and boats with electric motors. Full-facility campsites are available for overnight visitors.

  The Sweetwater Wetlands Project includes a network of trails that allow visitors to walk along the berms that form the enhancement wetland, an outdoor classroom, a viewing tower, and a visitors center.

  The park is a ‘gateway site’ for the Great Florida Birding Trail.

  The space shuttle could be seen from Paynes Prairie about a minute into its flight.

  The Gainesville-Hawthorne State Trail also runs through Paynes Prairie. Several scenic view points lead off of the trail and into the park. Wildlife will often come up to the trail at certain times in the day.</p>
